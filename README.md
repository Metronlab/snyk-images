An *experimental* build toolchain for Snyk Docker images.

## Design goals

* Make it easy to provide images which match upstream development environments, for example
  covering the range of different software versions and operating systems in common usage
* Minimize the ammount of configuration we need to maintain per image
* Avoid the need to install a Node development environment for non-Node users

## Toolchain

### Usage

When run, the `build` target will build an image for every parent image specified in both `linux` and `alpine` files. The only modifications made are to install the latest version of Snyk.

```
make build
```

Note that this requires a modern version of Docker with BuildKit enabled. You can do this in most cases by setting `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.


### Maintenance

Potentially the lists of images in `linux` and `alpine` could grow large, so keeping them in alphabetical order should help to maintain some semblance of order. The following command will sort both files.

```
make sort
```

As well as knowing the images build correctly it's useful to have a basic test suite. At present this is very minimal, mainly a demonstrating using [Structure Tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test). You don't need anything except Docker installed locally to run the tests.

```
make test
```
